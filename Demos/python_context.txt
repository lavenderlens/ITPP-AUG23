Python: an object-oriented programming language; arguably easier to learn than Java, C# etc.

Python is mostly used for scripting, not for the building of apps

Current version: 3.11

Installation: python.org/downloads

Python was re-written between version 2 and 3; v2 code is incompatible with v3 code

Much of what we do has not changed for a long time.

Once installed (the interpreter)

Python can be run two ways:

Script mode

Interactive / terminal

There are many Python implementations; the default one is written in C 

There are other implementations: Jython; IronPython etc.

Python editors: PyCharm, Spyder, Idle (specific); Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Sublime, Atom (generic)
